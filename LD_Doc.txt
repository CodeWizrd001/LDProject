module Mux2x1(out,in1,in2,s);

Input : 
	1. in1,in2
		input feeded into the component
	2. s
		signal input
Output : 
	out
		to store and give out the final output
Behavior :
		 Acts as the output which saves the values of input based on the value of s


module Or(out,a,b);

Input :
	1.a,b
		input that needed to be or gated
Output :
	out 
		to store and give out the final output
Behavior : 
		Represents as the or gate to give out the final or-ed output.


Module PEncoder(out,used,in1,in2,in3,in4);

Inout :
	 in1,in2,in3,in4
		represents the signal position in of the traffic light signal at a partivular instant.
Output :
	out 
		stores the traffic signal poition based on the input values
Behavior :
		Stores the values of state of the traffic signal position that need to executed at the 			moment. This is used when there is a special occassion where the traffic signals needed 			to manipulated in favour of a particu;ar vehivle movement e.g: Ambulance, VIP 				transportation. This is input completely under the sensor control.







module Decoder(o1,o2,o3,o4,in);

Input : 
	[1:0]in 
		accepts the signal for the traffic controller that is obtained 
Output 
	o1,o2,o3,o4
		stores the output for the enabler for the LightBoard
Behavior 
		acts as a Deccoder to assign the value to each of LightBoard




module TimerIC(clk,reset,mode,BoardSelect) ;
input :
	clk
		to change to the next value of timer. acts as the clock 
	reset 
		to change the value to its original value to reset the value. this is used when the priority 			encoder is used to pull 0the system back to the original condition after the emergency 			sutuation is been handled.
output :
	mode 
		to select among the 2 modes of the traffic signal.
	BoardSelect
		to enable the traffic signals that needed to put forth across the road

module LightBoard(enable,mode,mode_out,out) ;
input :
	enable
		to enable the LightBoard
	mode 
		to determine the mode of the traffic
output 
	mode_out 
		to reconfigure the opposite traffic signal depending on the current light signal
	[4:0]out
		binary digits representing the color that needed to be emitted
			5'b (red)(orange)(Green-left)(Green-Front)(Green-Right)


module TrafficSignal(clk,imgDataOut,imgData,active,p,e) ;
